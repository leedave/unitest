# Unitest #

Generate PHP Unit Tests (PHPUnit) from regular PHP classes. 

Most people don't do Unit Testing because it is too much fuss to get it all set 
up and to write all test classes. This tool gives you the test classes. 

Just edit the tests or delete the ones you don't want. All you need to get this 
to run is a JSON file containing an array of all class names that need a test 
Class.
